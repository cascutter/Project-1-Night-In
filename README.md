# Project 1: Night In App

Night In is a mobile-first app that uses multiple APIs to retrieve movie selections, recipes, and cocktails based on user input. This application uses a combination of HTML, CSS using the Bulma framework, JavaScript, jQuery, third-party APIs, and ajax. 

## Motivation

This project was created to provide a sleek, easy to use, multi-source content search mobile-first application with the intention of allowing the user ample opportunity for discovery and variety. 

### User Story

As a home-body or person adhereing to social distancing guidelines, I want new ideas for things I can make or do at home so that I may add some variety to my normal routine and genuinely enjoy the at-home experience.

## Features



* Night In has four distinct pages: a homepage, movie search, recipe search, and cocktail search.

* The homepage consists of three link buttons, inviting the user to choose where they gein their experience.

* The movie search page consists of a dropdown menu where the user can select their genre of interest. When the user makes their selection, they are presented with a list of popular movie titles, each of which has a brief summary, a poster image, the average viewer rating, and a link to the IMDB page for that title.

* The recipe search page consists of two search bars. The first searches for recipes based on specific ingredients input by the user, seperated by commas. The second searches by recipe keyword (such as casserole). Once one or both of these parameters have been set by the user, they are presented with a list of recipes, each of which has an image (if available), a short list of main ingredients, and a link to the full recipe on an external site.

* The cocktails search page consists of a search bar for the user to input their desired spirit. Once the user has set this parameter, they are presented with a list of cocktails, each of which is has an image, a list of ingredients, and directions for making the drink.

* Each page features link buttons to the other search pages so the user may navigate at their discretion.
